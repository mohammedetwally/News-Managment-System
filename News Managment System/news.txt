"Ukraine war likely to delay interest rate rises, says Man Group chief"
Russia's invasion of Ukraine is likely to mean that central banks will take longer to tighten the ultra-loose monetary policy they deployed during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the chief executive of Man Group, one of the world's biggest hedge fund managers. Luke Ellis, whose firm has $148.6bn in assets and reported record client inflows and a 230 per cent rise in profits for last year, said on Tuesday he was sceptical of whether markets had really seen the end of easy money, despite strong central bank rhetoric in recent months that interest rates would have to rise to combat inflation. The Ukraine situation pushes that out, Ellis told the Financial Times. It's likely that central banks will be less aggressive than they would have been, even though their problem is worse. This [war in Ukraine] is clearly inflationary, he added. Majority His comments come after central banks have targeted tighter monetary policy to try and control a surge in inflation, which hit a higher than forecast rate of 7.5 per cent in the US in January - a 40-year high. A recent poll of 45 economists by the FT and the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business found that a majority expected the federal funds rate to increase from its current near-zero level to a minimum of 1.5 per cent by the end of this year. Ellis also said that Man Group's funds had sold out of virtually all of their positions in Russia and Ukraine before Christmas, on fears that rising tensions would lead to capital controls. He said the firm still had what he described as a de minimis position in Russian equities, which it had not managed to sell but which makes no difference. Man on Tuesday reported record net inflows during the year of $13.7 billion (â‚¬12.2 billion), with $7.2 billion of these coming in the fourth quarter alone. Last year's flows equal almost the entirety of the $13.9 billion net inflows recorded by the whole of the $3.6tn hedge fund industry for 2021, as measured by data group eVestment. Statutory pre-tax profit jumped from $179mn in 2020 to $590mn last year, helped by a near-quadrupling of performance fee earnings and a rise in management fees. Gains While hedge funds made gains during the pandemic on average, helped by rising markets, it has often been the biggest firms who have prospered most. Man's rivals Citadel and Millennium, for instance, have posted large gains, helped by their diversification across assets, an ability to raise or cut risk quickly and their ability to hire traders. Man posted strong gains in a number of its funds last year, aided by rising markets and a move by investors into cheaper, so-called value stocks. Its $4.7 billion AHL Evolution fund, which bets on trends in almost 800 niche markets, rose 17 per cent, while its GLG Japan CoreAlpha fund gained 28.2 per cent. Its AHL TargetRisk strategy, which aims to balance risk across equities, government bonds, credit and inflation-linked bonds, gained 14.4 per cent and grew from $11.2 billion to $18.7 billion in assets during the year. Ellis said that after two consecutive quarters of record net inflows at the end of last year, the firm was back to normal now but added that clients had not hit the panic button in response to a choppy start to 2022 in markets. Man Group's share price was up 1 per cent to 195.05p at around midday on Tuesday. “ Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022

"Ukraine crisis puts Ireland in high-level diplomatic arena at UN"
Ireland's membership of the United Nations Security Council, now in the second year of its two-year tenure, has put the Government's foreign representatives on an elevated stage at a time when diplomatic efforts are wearing thin as Russia appears poised to invade more of Ukraine's sovereign territory. As a small nation with temporary membership of the UN's 15-nation inner sanctum, Ireland has contributed to council debates as the crisis has escalated, supporting Ukraine's sovereignty and territory integrity and calling Russia's actions a flagrant violation of international law. Ireland's ambassador to the UN, Geraldine Byrne Nason, spoke at an emergency session on Monday night which was called after Russian leader Vladimir Putin recognised Donetsk and Luhansk in Ukraine as independent entities and ordered Russian troops into the two regions. Ireland's ambassador to the UN, Geraldine Byrne Nason Even the calling of the meeting at short notice was in line with the Government's view that the council must remain relevant, engaged and open to meet as crises dictates. The fact that Russia holds the council's rotating presidency makes statements at these meetings even more important. Russian veto Russia's veto power as one of the five permanent members of the council - with ally China as another â€˜P5â€™ member - limits resolutions being passed against the Kremlin or any unanimous declaration of condemnation against Putin, but the council is seen as playing an important role in the public-relations war. The view within the Biden administration is that this is a global crisis and the UN Security Council is an appropriate forum and has an important role to play, said Tom Wright, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the US-based foreign policy think tank. Even if it is not going to be possible to get action, this is where the case can be made in the court of global public opinion. The council can be used as a forum to sway countries that might have good relations with Russian or to raise concern about the humanitarian consequences of Russia's actions. It is not just about condemnation but trying to mobilise like-minded countries to mitigate some of the worst consequences of the invasion, said Wright. The powerful speech delivered by Kenya's ambassador to the UN Martin Kimani at Monday's emergency session, which generated headlines around the world, shows the capacity of small nations to be the pebble in the shoe of large nations. This situation echoes our history, Kimani said. Kenya and almost every African country was birthed by the end of an empire. Our borders are not of our own drawings. They were drawn in the distant colonial metropoles of London, Paris and Lisbon with no regard for the ancient nations that they cleaved apart. The Kenyan statement showed how even small countries could use the highest level of a country's representation globally to put a strong statement on the historical record. Global perspective. It wasn't just a condemnation but it was setting it in the context of colonialism and giving the global perspective of what this represented, said Wright. Nason has also evoked Ireland's own past in voicing support for Ukraine, telling the council last week that its sovereign right to defend itself was a right that Ireland struggled to obtain. As one of only two EU states on the council, there will be a lot of pressure on Irish officials to reflect the EU position on Ukraine. We will stick quite close to France, â€ said one diplomat. Another international forum the Government will have an eye on is the Council of Europe, where Ireland takes over as chair in May. Russia is a member of the 47-nation council and Irish diplomats could find themselves in another central role when Russia's suspension from the council could be considered, should the situation deteriorate further in Ukraine. If you put yourself forward for positions, you have to be prepared to take on the difficult stuff, said one Irish official.
